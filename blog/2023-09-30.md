# Monthly Subscription Fee for ChatGPT Completely Removed!

Dear user

We have always been committed to providing users with the best OpenAI services at a low cost. Now, we are excited to announce that we are eliminating the monthly subscription fee for ChatGPT! Instead, we are adopting a pay-as-you-go billing model, allowing the general public to use GPT-4 at a low cost, and GPT-3.5 users will no longer have to bear the fixed expense of $5 per month.

We have been able to achieve all of this thanks to the Serverless architecture we have chosen. This not only reduces monthly costs for our users but also allows us to go further! In order to provide users with a better experience, we will temporarily abandon the website https://chat.abandon.ai. Instead, you can continue to access and use ChatGPT on https://app.abandon.ai, where GPT-4 is also available.

Our goal has always been to provide users with the highest quality and affordable artificial intelligence services. We believe that this change will allow more people to experience the powerful capabilities of OpenAI and bring more convenience to your work, study, and entertainment.

Thank you for your continued support! If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact our customer service team.

Happy using!

Team AbandonAI
