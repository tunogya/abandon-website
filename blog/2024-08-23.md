# G.O Pass Technical Documentation for Apple App Store Review

## Overview

G.O Pass is a decentralized digital passport application that allows users to prove their G.O status while maintaining
anonymity. The app enables users to access exclusive offline services and online content as our GoWith partners expand.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identity**: Users can authenticate their G.O status without revealing personal information.
- **Public/Private Key Pair**: Upon downloading the app, a unique public/private key pair is automatically generated.
  - **Public Key**: Displayed within the app for verification purposes.
  - **Private Key**: Securely stored within the app and never exposed to the user.
- **Secure Authentication**: Users can enjoy seamless authentication with GoWith partners without needing to disclose
  their identity.
- **Reauthentication Process**: If the app is uninstalled, the private key is lost. Users wishing to reauthenticate must
  contact the GoWith platform for a new contract.

## Technical Architecture

### Key Generation

1. **Key Pair Creation**:

- When the user downloads the app, the system generates a public/private key pair using a secure cryptographic
  algorithm (e.g., RSA or ECC).
- The public key is displayed in the app interface.
- The private key is encrypted and securely stored on the device.

### Data Security

- **Private Key Storage**: The private key is never displayed or exposed to the user, ensuring maximum security.
- **Uninstallation Impact**: If the app is uninstalled, the private key is irretrievably lost. This ensures that the
  user's identity cannot be reconstructed without reauthentication.

### Reauthentication Process

1. **Uninstallation**:

- If the user uninstalls the app, the private key is deleted from the device.

2. **Reinstallation**:

- Users wishing to reauthenticate must contact the GoWith platform.
- A new contract will be established, and a new public/private key pair will be generated.

### User Experience

- **Onboarding**:
  - Users will go through a simple onboarding process where they will receive their public key and understand the
    implications of the private key.
- **Accessing Services**:
  - Users can use their public key to access exclusive services offered by GoWith partners.

## Privacy Considerations

G.O Pass is designed with user privacy in mind. The app does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII)
from the users. All transactions are conducted anonymously, ensuring that users can enjoy services without compromising
their identity.

## Compliance

G.O Pass adheres to relevant data protection regulations and guidelines, including GDPR and CCPA, ensuring that user
data is handled responsibly and ethically.

## Conclusion

G.O Pass is a cutting-edge application that leverages decentralized identity technology to provide users with secure and
anonymous access to exclusive services. The appâ€™s design prioritizes user privacy and security, making it an ideal
solution for individuals seeking to maintain their anonymity while enjoying personalized services.
