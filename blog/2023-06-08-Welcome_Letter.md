# Welcome Letter

Congratulations on starting your new business! We're proud to see a new
entrepreneur in the business community! We have put together a list of
recommended steps to help you build and run your new business.
1. Execute your Organizational Documents

   A corporation has Bylaws. This document is important to the business because it defines
   your company's internal structure and procedures. It also defines the rights and
   responsibilities of the shareholders, directors, and officers, how meetings are held, what
   votes are required to take action, how stock should be issued, etc. We offer a free
   sample of Bylaws for you to refer to, and you can access it anytime on your Zenind
   Dashboard - Corporate Documents. The corporation should always keep its executed
   Bylaws safe.


2. Apply for a Federal EIN (Employer Identification Number)

   A corporation is a separate entity, and it needs to have a separate tax identification
   number from its owners, even if you are the only shareholder of the corporation. If you
   wish to open a bank account or accept credit card payments, these financial institutions
   will need the corporation's EIN on file. EIN is also required by the Internal Revenue
   Service when you file your business tax returns. Zenind Business Formation Suite offers
   an EIN obtainment service, and we will prepare the EIN Application document for you.
   Please go to your Zenind Dashboard and locate the EIN Application in the Corporate
   Documents section. You should review all the details on the application form and sign it
   if nothing needs to be corrected. The signed EIN Application should be scanned and
   uploaded to Zenind Dashboard - Send Documents, and we will go ahead and file the
   document with the Internal Revenue Service. You will be notified via email once there is
   an update regarding your EIN Application, and you will be able to access the EIN and
   the EIN confirmation letter.


3. Open a Business Bank Account

   You will need to create a separate business bank account to keep all business
   transactions separate from your personal transactions. This step not only will streamline
   your business accounting and tax reporting, but it’s essential to maintaining the
   “corporate veil” that minimizes your personal liability. Most banks will require the
   business’ formation documents, organizational documents, and an EIN to open the bank
   account. If you are not in the United States or wish to open an online bank account, you
   may want to check our recommended online banking partners on Zenind Dashboard -
   App Marketplace.


4. Apply for Business Licenses, Permits, and Sales Tax Registrations

   A business license gives you the legal right to operate your business. Some businesses
   may require federal and/or local licenses to operate (the specifics will depend on your
   business activities and location). You can contact a lawyer or accountant to help you
   determine which licenses you need.


5. Check out our App Marketplace

   You can explore our recommended apps for new businesses on Zenind Dashboard -
   App Marketplace. You may find some useful services you need, from fintech and
   website builders to co-working spaces.


   We wish you all the best with your new business venture.
