# Usage policies

We’ve recently updated our usage policies to be clearer and more specific.

We want everyone to use our tools safely and responsibly. That’s why we’ve created usage policies that apply to all users of AbandonAI’s models, tools, and services. By following them, you’ll ensure that our technology is used for good.

If we discover that your product or usage doesn’t follow these policies, we may ask you to make necessary changes. Repeated or serious violations may result in further action, including suspending or terminating your account.

Our policies may change as we learn more about use and abuse of our models.

We have further requirements for certain uses of our models:

2. Automated systems (including conversational AI and chatbots) must disclose to users that they are interacting with an AI system. With the exception of chatbots that depict historical public figures, products that simulate another person must either have that person's explicit consent or be clearly labeled as “simulated” or “parody.”
3. Use of model outputs in livestreams, demonstrations, and research are subject to our Sharing & Publication Policy.

You can use our free moderation endpoint and safety best practices to help you keep your app safe.

## Platform policy
Our API is being used to power businesses across many sectors and technology platforms. From iOS Apps to websites to Slack, the simplicity of our API makes it possible to integrate into a wide array of use cases. Subject to the use case restrictions mentioned above, we allow the integration of our API into products on all major technology platforms, app stores, and beyond.

## Plugin policies
In addition to the disallowed usages of our models detailed above, we have additional requirements for developers building plugins:

1. The plugin manifest must have a clearly stated description that matches the functionality of the API exposed to the model.
2. Don’t include irrelevant, unnecessary, or deceptive terms or instructions in the plugin manifest, OpenAPI endpoint descriptions, or plugin response messages. This includes instructions to avoid using other plugins, or instructions that attempt to steer or set model behavior.
3. Don’t use plugins to circumvent or interfere with AbandonAI’s safety systems.
4. Don’t use plugins to automate conversations with real people, whether by simulating a human-like response or by replying with pre-programmed messages.
5. Plugins that distribute personal communications or content generated by ChatGPT (such as emails, messages, or other content) must indicate that the content was AI-generated.

Like our other usage policies, we expect our plugin policies to change as we learn more about use and abuse of plugins.
